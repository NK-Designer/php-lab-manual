2.Program to do different types of Sorting in PHP 

Aim: 
To perform different types of sorting in PHP. 


Procedure: 
 Declare the array variable $numbers to set the maximum values in it. 
 Compute the array length by specifying count() function to the declared variable. 
 By using rsort built-in function descending order can be performed. 
 By using sort function ascending order can be performed. 
 For loop is used to iterate and manipulate the array list. 
 Use echo statements to print the resultant value. 


Program: 
<?php 
$numbers = array(4, 6, 2, 22, 11); 
rsort($numbers); 
echo "Descending Order"; 
echo "<br>"; 
$arrlength = count($numbers); 
for($x = 0; $x < $arrlength; $x++) 
{ 
echo $numbers[$x]; 
echo "<br>"; 
} 
sort($numbers); 
echo "Ascending Order"; 
echo "<br>"; 
$arrlength = count($numbers); 
for($x = 0; $x < $arrlength; $x++) 
{ 
echo $numbers[$x]; 
echo "<br>"; 
} 
?>
